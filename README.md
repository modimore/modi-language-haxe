# atom-haxe-grammar

A Haxe language grammar for the Atom text editor.

Work in progress. May eventually be submitted for inclusion in [language-haxe] Atom package.

Some grammar rules taken from [language-haxe] as noted in grammar file.

## Improvements

This package is different in the following ways that I know of from [language-haxe]:

* Regex highlighting
* Multiple type parameters
* Nested type parameters
* Some different highlighting choices
* Identifies user-defined constants

## To-Do

* Clean up grammar generally
* Handle field completions
* Look through macro rules (taken from [language-haxe]).
* Write accompanying hxml grammar.
